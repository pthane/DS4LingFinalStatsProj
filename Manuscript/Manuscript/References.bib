	abstract = {It has been suggested that tense and aspect distributions are very difficult to learn in a second language (L2), they are prone to fossilize universally, and their interpretive properties are subject to a critical period (Coppieters, 1987). This study focuses on the acquisition of the semantic implications of the preterite-imperfect contrast in Spanish by English-speaking individuals of very advanced proficiency in Spanish who were not living in a Spanish-speaking country. By assuming that aspect is encoded in a functional category where the features [+/-perfective] are checked, depending on the language (Giorgi \& Pianesi, 1997), this study asks whether ultimate attainment in the aspectual domain is possible and whether features of functional categories not selected in early childhood are subject to a critical period, as Hawkins and Chan's (1997) Failed Formal Features Hypothesis states. Experimental evidence from two tasks probing the interpretations of perfective and imperfective aspectual forms in Spanish suggests that many learners (almost 30\%) in our total subject pool (including advanced to near-native speakers) and 70\% of the near-native group performed like native speakers on all sentence types in all tasks. Although aspect is certainly a difficult area to master, particularly because the meanings of the imperfect are acquired quite late, L2 learners are clearly able to overcome the parametric options of their native language. At least for this domain, it is suggested that access to Universal Grammar does not necessarily decay with age in L2 acquisition.},

This view contrasts with alternative explanations for the steady-state representation of these grammars that suggest truncated acquisition or erosion are the primary culprits of perceived language loss. In production and comprehension processes for heritage bilinguals, particular elements are more diﬃcult to access than others, leading to diﬀerential ways to access representations and feature values. To illustrate and support this hypothesis, we build on previous work by examining the interpretation and use of obligatory mood selection in Spanish desiderative constructions in three groups of heritage speakers with diﬀerent levels of language proﬁciency.},

This study aimed to uncover the extent to which lexical frequency aﬀects the acquisition of gender assignment and gender agreement and to account for possible factors behind heritage language variability. Thirty-nine English-dominant heritage speakers of Spanish completed a lexical knowledge screening task (Multilingual Naming Test (MiNT)) along with an elicited production task (EPT), a forced choice task (FCT), and a self-rating lexical frequency task (SRLFT). Heritage speakers performed more successfully with high-frequency lexical items in both the EPT and the FCT, which examined their acquisition of gender assignment and gender agreement, respectively. Noun canonicity also aﬀected their performance in both tasks. However, heritage speakers presented diﬀerences between tasks—we found an overextension of the masculine as well as productive vocabulary knowledge eﬀects in the EPT, whereas the FCT showed an overextension of the feminine and no productive vocabulary knowledge eﬀects. We suggest that lexical frequency, determined by the SRLFT, and productive vocabulary knowledge, as measured by the MiNT, account for the variability in the acquisition of gender assignment but not on gender agreement, supporting previous claims that production is more challenging than comprehension for bilinguals.},

	title = {The acquisition of the syntactic and morphological properties of {Spanish} imperatives in heritage and second language},
	url = {https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/64378/},
	doi = {10.7282/T3-2GA4-6F63},
	abstract = {Imperatives are one of the three major clause types of human language, along with declaratives and interrogatives (Aikhenvald, 2010; Alcázar \&amp; Saltarelli, 2014; Portner, 2016). Imperatives are usually employed to express commands, but they can convey other meanings such as entreaties, requests, advice or instructions (Aikhenvald, 2010). The current study investigates the acquisition of syntactic and morphological properties of imperatives in Spanish in order to test previous proposals on the order of acquisition of language components for L2 learners and heritage speakers. Moreover, this study examines whether the acquisition of this structure is modulated by extra-linguistic factors (e.g., proficiency in Spanish, age of onset of acquisition of Spanish and English, and patterns of language exposure and use) and by lexical frequency (i.e., how frequently a given lexical item appears in the input).Previous proposals on the order of acquisition of language components in L2 learners agree on that morphology is the most challenging language component to acquire for L2 learners (Jiang, 2000; Lardiere, 2008, 2009; Slabakova, 2013). A similar focus on the difficulty to acquire morphology is found in proposals on heritage language acquisition and maintenance (Putnam \&amp; Sánchez, 2013). This study aims to test the validity of these proposals by examining the acquisition of imperatives in Spanish, which present a complex syntax and a relatively poor morphology (Alcázar \&amp; Saltarelli, 2013; Ezeizabarrena, 1997; Rivero \&amp; Terzi, 1995). Furthermore, this study also tests previous approaches that underline the importance of language activation in the acquisition of second and heritage languages (Gollan, Weissberger, Runnqvist, Montoya, \&amp; Cera, 2012; Paradis, 1993; Putnam \&amp; Sánchez) by examining the role of extra-linguistic factors that measure the activation of their non-dominant language, Spanish, throughout their lives. Along the lines of language activation, this study also investigates the effects of lexical frequency on the acquisition of morphology. Specifically, lexical frequency is used as a proxy for language activation: more frequent lexical items are more frequently activated in the bilingual mind for production and comprehension purposes (Putnam \&amp; Sánchez, 2013).A group of L2 learners (n = 51) and heritage speakers (n = 58) of varied proficiency levels completed an elicited production task, an acceptability judgment task, and a self-reported lexical frequency test, as well as several screening tasks and tests. A group of 12 Spanish-dominant bilinguals and 20 Spanish instructors served as comparison groups for the heritage speakers and the L2 learners, respectively. The results, which are not consistent with previous second language proposals and hypotheses (Jiang, 2000; Lardiere, 2008, 2009; Slabakova, 2013), show that L2 learners acquire some functional morphology, namely number morphology (e.g., ¡mira! ‘(singular you) Look!’ vs ¡miren! ‘(plural you) Look!’), which is less challenging than purely syntactic operations, as seen in clitic placement. The heritage speakers, on the other hand, present a more stable syntax than morphology, consistently with Putnam and Sánchez (2013). Additionally, language activation, as measured by proficiency and age of onset of acquisition of Spanish and English, has an effect on the acquisition of the properties under examination. On the other hand, patterns of language exposure and use, and lexical frequency (e.g., ¡mira! ‘Look!’ vs ¡cose! ‘Sew!’) only play a role in the acquisition of morphology in heritage speakers, but not in L2 learners. These findings support claims that heritage language activation is crucial for its acquisition and maintenance (Putnam \&amp; Sánchez, 2013) and that heritage speakers present differential access to their grammatical knowledge as a function of lexical frequency (Pérez-Cortés, Putnam, \&amp; Sánchez, 2019).The contributions of this study are threefold: First, this is the first study that investigates the acquisition of Spanish imperatives in L2 learners and heritage speakers. Second, this study challenges previous literature (Lardiere, 2008, 2009; Slabakova, 2013, 2019) by finding that L2 learners acquire functional morphology earlier than a purely syntactic operation. Third, this is the first study that found lexical frequency effects in the acquisition of morphology with morphologically regular verbs in heritage speakers.},
